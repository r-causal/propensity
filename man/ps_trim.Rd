\title{Trim Propensity Scores With NAs (Preserving Original Length)}
\usage{
ps_trim(
  ps,
  exposure = NULL,
  method = c("ps", "adaptive", "pctl", "pref", "cr"),
  lower = NULL,
  upper = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A numeric vector in (0,1).}

\item{exposure}{For methods like \code{"pref"} or \code{"cr"}, a 0/1 vector.}

\item{method}{One of \code{c("ps", "adaptive", "pctl", "pref", "cr")}.}

\item{lower, upper}{Numeric cutoffs or quantiles. If \code{NULL}, defaults vary by method.}
}
\value{
A \code{ps_trim} object (numeric vector). The attribute \code{ps_trim_meta} stores metadata.
}
\description{
\code{ps_trim()} applies various trimming methods to a propensity-score vector,
returning a new vector of the \emph{same length}, with trimmed entries replaced by NA.
The object is given class \code{"ps_trim"}, and you can inspect further metadata in
\code{ps_trim_meta(x)}. After running \code{ps_trim()}, you should refit the model with
\code{ps_refit()}.
}
\details{
The returned object is a \strong{\code{ps_trim}} vector of the same length as \code{ps}, but
with trimmed entries replaced by \code{NA}.
An attribute \code{ps_trim_meta} contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{method}: Which trimming method was used
\item \code{keep_idx}: Indices retained
\item \code{trimmed_idx}: Indices replaced by \code{NA}
\item Possibly other fields such as final cutoffs, etc.
}
