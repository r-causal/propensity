\description{
\code{is_ps_truncated()} is an S3 generic that returns \code{TRUE} if its
argument represents a \code{ps_trunc} object or \code{psw} object created from
truncated propensity scores. \code{is_ps_truncated()} is a question about whether
the propensity scores \emph{have} been truncated, as opposed to
\code{\link[=is_unit_truncated]{is_unit_truncated()}}, which is a question about which \emph{units} have been
truncated.
