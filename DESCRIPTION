Description: Calculates propensity score weights for multiple causal
    estimands across binary, continuous, and categorical exposures.
    Provides methods for handling extreme propensity scores through
    trimming, truncation, and calibration. Includes inverse probability
    weighted estimators that correctly account for propensity score
    estimation uncertainty.
