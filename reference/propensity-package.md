# propensity: A Toolkit for Calculating and Working with Propensity Scores

A comprehensive toolkit for propensity score analysis in causal
inference. Supports calculating propensity score weights for multiple
causal estimands across binary, continuous, and categorical exposures.
Provides methods for handling extreme propensity scores through
trimming, truncation, and calibration. Includes inverse probability
weighted estimators that correctly accounts for propensity score
estimation uncertainty.
